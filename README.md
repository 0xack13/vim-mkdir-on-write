# vim-mkdir-on-write
Lets Vim automatically create required parent directories when writing a file, if they don't exist.

This is taken from a [script posted on Stack Overflow][1].

Of course we are [pathogen][2] compatible.

This small snippet is currently not under active development. However, I will accept pull requests if they're not a lot of work. If it's too much, I might ask you to take over maintainership. ;)
